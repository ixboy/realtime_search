This is a Project I got from a company called Helpjuice as part of their interview process.
I was asked to create a blog App with a realtime search box in it, where users search articles, and then to have analytics that display what users were searching for.
My goal was to record their input in realtime and ultimately display analytics & trends on what people are searching for the most. I was asked to finish the whole project within 48 hours. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the project on time. Due to this, I didn't make it to the next stage of their interview process.
